CIT 591 FINAL PROJECT TEAM 83
Snake Game


TEAM MEMBERS
Qi Chen
Xiaoge Fan
Yunyang Li

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The team decided to indulge the nostalgia and build the classic game Snake.

The game started just like the classic Snake game where a short snake is born in a forest setting. Controled by the user using the arrow keys, the snake turns and advances, eats apples, and gets longer. When the snake hits the boundry or itself, the game is over. 

Additionally, this project contains three more difficulty levels as we challenge the users and ourselves. Complete description of the different levels can be found in README.

Players' score of the round and the highest score are recorded and displayed in the game if the user plays more than one round.

Xiaoge Fan: project design, CRC documentation, game level 2, graphic materials for level 2
